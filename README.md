# EMEmulator
This project provides a complete set of models and driver scripts, enabling researchers to quickly obtain an eye movement simulator through 3D printing for eye-tracking sensor or eye tracker measurements.

In theory, all users can customize any component of this project according to their research objectives, such as the design of the head model, the type of servo motors, or the connection direction of eye movements.

The head model used in this project is derived from https://www.thingiverse.com/

The eye movement mechanism design is inspired by the work of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXxbQefl1c&t=778s
